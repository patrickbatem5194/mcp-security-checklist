## Why This Exists

MCP is being adopted rapidly. Security guidance is lagging behind.

This checklist gives security engineers, platform teams, and technical leaders a **clear, actionable baseline** for securing MCP deployments — whether you're shipping an internal tool or a customer-facing AI agent.

It is **not** vendor-specific, complete, or a replacement for a full security review. It is a starting point.

## ✅ Quick-Start: Top 10 Controls

If you do nothing else, cover these:

1. **Never expose MCP over the public internet without mTLS or equivalent.**
2. **Scope every tool to the minimum necessary permissions.**
3. **Validate and sanitize all inputs before they reach tool execution.**
4. **Log every tool invocation with the originating session context.**
5. **Set rate limits on both the MCP server and any downstream APIs it calls.**
6. **Treat agent sessions as untrusted by default — validate intent, not just auth tokens.**
7. **Separate read and write tool categories; require explicit approval for write operations in sensitive contexts.**
8. **Rotate credentials used by MCP servers on a defined schedule.**
9. **Monitor for behavioral anomalies: unusual tool chains, high-frequency calls, off-hours access.**
10. **Conduct a tool inventory review before every production deployment.**

## 📌 Scope & Limitations

This checklist covers:
- MCP server deployment and configuration security
- Inbound session and API request security
- Agent-to-tool interaction surface
- Operational monitoring and detection

This checklist **does not** cover:
- Model weights or training pipeline security
- End-user data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- General cloud infrastructure hardening
